# AcedIt — Claude Code briefing

This file is auto-loaded by any Claude Code session opened in this directory. It is the canonical handoff for the in-progress migration of the AcedIt app off Base44.

## What is AcedIt

AcedIt (acedit.au) is a gamified VCE study app for Australian high schoolers. It bundles AI study tools (essay planner, math tutor, note summariser, concept explainer, English mentor, exam simulator, etc.), quizzes, flashcards, leaderboards, goals, streaks, and XP. ~30 active / ~130 signed-up users on the live site.

## Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite 6, Tailwind 3.4, shadcn/Radix, framer-motion, react-router 6. JavaScript only (no TS).
- **Local server**: `server.mjs` (Express 5) on port 3001 — proxies Anthropic Claude and hosts ported Base44 functions.
- **Vite dev server**: port 5173. `npm run dev` runs both via `concurrently`.
- **Backend (target)**: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage). Project: `qhwyjycihgtxpzkitmpt.supabase.co`.
- **Auth**: Google OAuth (set up in Supabase, app code still uses Base44 — not yet swapped).
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude (default `claude-sonnet-4-6`, set in `server.mjs:17`). Replaces Base44's metered LLM.

## Migration plan (the "1% diff dual-run" strategy — already chosen)

The app reads/writes through shims that route to either Base44 or Supabase based on a runtime flag, so we cut over per-entity rather than big-bang.

- `src/api/runtimeConfig.js` — toggle (`VITE_USE_SUPABASE` env or `window.__forceSupabase(true)` in console).
- `src/api/entitiesShim.js`, `src/api/functionsShim.js` — route reads/writes/calls.
- `src/api/supabaseClient.js` — Supabase client + `PORTED_FUNCTIONS` list.
- `src/api/_dualRunDevTools.js` — diff helpers.

## Phase status

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Local replication of Base44 export | done |
| 2 | UI uplift (Duolingo/Cal-AI vibe, design tokens, page-by-page restyle, LaTeX, streaming) | done |
| 3a | Supabase schema + migrations 0001–0006 | done (applied) |
| 3b | Port Base44 serverless functions into `server.mjs` | **18 of 18 done** (3 challenge + 2 past papers deprecated; admin 3 deferred post-cutover; Stripe 4 ported 2026-05-05 — needs ngrok for webhook testing in dev) |
| 3c | Data migration script + cutover for ~130 users | **done** (132 user_profiles + 42 leaderboards migrated 2026-05-08; smaller entities skipped — users re-select subjects post-cutover) |
| 3d | Swap `AuthContext.jsx` from Base44 to Supabase Google OAuth | **done** (2026-05-08; dual-run via `shouldUseSupabase()` toggle, Base44 path preserved for rollback) |
| 4 | Capacitor wrap → iOS app via Xcode | future |

## The AcedIt ATAR

The flagship score everything else is standardised around. 0–99.95, trailing 28
days, **not** a VCAA prediction and the UI says so wherever it appears. Computed
in `computeAcedItATAR` (`server.mjs`), stored on `user_profiles.acedit_atar` +
`atar_components`, mirrored to `leaderboards`.

Mastery 28% · consistency 27% · effort 22% · breadth 13% · planning 10%.
Unranked under 3 study days. Planning is goals set-and-met, planned blocks kept,
prep started before an assessment, and declared study intents actually followed
— its weights live in `computePlanning`.

Every component reports the evidence behind it in `atar_components`, and Ranked
renders it under each bar. If you add a component, add its counts too — a bare
percentage tells a student nothing they can act on. `planningEvidence` in
`src/lib/atarBands.js` is the one wording, shared by Ranked and AtarPanel.

Two traps this component has fallen into already, both fixed 2026-08-28:

- **Read every table the behaviour lands in.** Pomodoro, active recall,
  blurting and spaced repetition write to `study_techniques`; only quizzes and
  the activity tracker write to `study_sessions`. Planning read just the latter,
  so kept blocks, prep and kept intents all scored near zero for students who
  used the Study page — the exact "planning is 22" the Ranked comment cites.
- **Never score a student on a signal they can't reach.** Prep is only
  applicable once an assessment is on the calendar and its lead-up has begun;
  its weight is redistributed when there isn't one, rather than banked as a
  zero. Same rule for grading an assessment that's still two weeks out.

- **`xp_awarded > 0` is not "did they study".** All five components read one
  predicate now: an event counts if it paid XP *or* was capped. The caps govern
  the XP economy, not the study log — `awardXPIncremental` says as much where it
  writes the row ("capping the payout must not stop the counting") — so gating
  on payout quietly deleted a student's *best* days from consistency, effort,
  mastery and breadth. A zero-content session (raw XP zero, uncapped) still
  doesn't count; there's no work in it to measure. Velocity-capped rows count
  too: 600 XP/hour is reachable honestly with a 2× streak on a long session.

Effort totals minutes per day and clamps each day at `EFFORT_DAILY_MINUTE_CAP`,
because `duration_minutes` comes from the client. The daily XP cap used to bound
this incidentally, and badly — where it landed moved with the student's streak
multiplier. And every window query pages (`fetchAllRows`): an unordered
`.limit(n)` on `xp_events` handed heavy users an arbitrary prefix of their own
log, which cost them breadth, effort and mastery at once.

Client mirror of the band thresholds is `src/lib/atarBands.js`. Server is the
source of truth; keep them in sync.

## Quizzes: parts, ink, and itemised marking

**`quizSchema.js` is an adapter, not a format.** VCAA questions come in parts —
a stem, then (a), (b), (c) worth different marks. 76 places across thirteen
files read `.questions` and QuizPlayer alone branches on `type === 'mcq'` 41
times, so nothing branches on "is this the new shape": `normaliseQuestion`
turns BOTH into a stem plus one or more parts, and a legacy question becomes a
stem with a single unlabelled part.

**Answer keys are load-bearing.** Every attempt ever saved keys answers by
question index (`user_answers[3]`). A single-part question therefore keeps the
bare index — "3", not "3a" — or every existing attempt reads back as
unanswered. Only genuinely multi-part questions suffix.

Marks are the currency: score is a percentage of marks available, not of
questions answered, so a four-mark part b counts double a two-mark part a.
Three places used to compute a question's allocation by hand as
`q.type === 'mcq' ? 1 : (q.marks || 5)` and all three read 5 for a multipart
question worth nine — they go through `normaliseQuestion(q, i).marks` now,
which returns exactly the old value for a legacy question.

**The player branches ONCE.** `MultipartQuestion` owns the whole part-shaped
screen — stem in a quieter box, parts stacked below with the allocation
right-aligned the way a paper prints it, textarea rows scaling with the marks.
Everything else stays on the path it always took, which is why this cannot
reach the quizzes that already exist. Marking stays ONE entry per question with
the parts laid out inside the prompt, because the score, the feedback array and
the attempt row are all indexed by question.

Only the main generator (`handleGenerateQuiz`) emits parts. Reshuffle still
produces flat questions.

**Annotations point at characters, and an unquotable one is dropped.** The
marker returns a verbatim `quote` from the student's answer; `annotate.js`
finds it by EXACT string match and underlines only those characters, in place,
in their own paragraph. No fuzzy matching — underlining the wrong six words and
saying they cost a mark sends a student to rewrite a sentence that was fine and
costs the next annotation its credibility. Overlaps are dropped for the same
reason.

**An annotation POINTS. It does not hold the feedback.** It used to: what the
assessor wanted, the rewrites, and the save button all lived in a note that
opened on hover. Two failures came out of that and neither was tunable. The
note is portalled to the body, so reaching toward the button left the phrase
and closed it — you could see the save button and not get to it. And a mark
with no quotable phrase had nowhere to put its explanation at all, which is
backwards: "does not name the transfer" is unquotable precisely because the
words are absent, so the marks that most needed explaining were the ones with
a single line and no button.

All of it lives in `MarkModule` now, which is simply on the screen. The
underline opens a small label — which mark this belongs to, what it cost — and
tapping it scrolls to that module; pointing at a module's quote scrolls the
other way. The label is `pointer-events-none` and holds no action, so there is
nothing to catch. Content you need is never behind something that disappears
when you reach for it.

Still PORTALLED and positioned `fixed` from a measured rect, because
`position: fixed` resolves against a transformed ancestor and framer-motion
leaves an inline transform on every animated section here. AceRoam's header
records the same lesson. The old note's three-case viewport clamping went with
the note — a label two lines tall only needs below-else-above.

`wanted` is what the assessor was looking for, and it is ONLY ever a real
statement of what would have scored. It used to fall back to the criterion's
note, which is the examiner's remark on what went wrong, so a block headed "the
assessor wanted" printed a criticism — telling the student to write the
diagnosis. The criterion text is itself the statement of what was wanted and it
is already the heading.

The marker writes like a VCAA examiner's report: it addresses the RESPONSE and
not the student, names the command term when the answer misread it, gives no
praise, and says what a full-mark response would have contained.

An annotation was a strikethrough over the whole phrase, off in its own card.
Both were wrong: a strikethrough means DELETE THIS when the point is LOOK HERE,
and lifting the phrase out of the paragraph loses the thing that makes it land.

**The mistake bank is flashcards with a marker** (`topic: "Mistake bank"`), so a
banked mistake comes back through the SM-2 engine that already exists rather
than sitting in a list nobody opens — same move blurting's `makeCardsFromMisses`
already makes. The card asks for the FIX, never for the mistake; a card that
rehearses the error is the opposite of the point.

**Every mark a student can see, they can save.** One builder, `cardFromModule`,
over a mark rather than over a quote. There were two — one for a quoted phrase,
one for a missed criterion — and only the phrase one was ever wired up, so the
unquotable mistakes had no button. A lost mark NEVER fails to make a card: with
no fix and no `wanted`, the criterion text is a legitimate back, because it is
already phrased as what the assessor was looking for. A surviving imprecision
still needs a fix, or the card has no back at all.

Banking is keyed `q{index}:{criterion}` and guarded by a ref, not by state. Two
questions on one paper can genuinely drop the same criterion and both are worth
rehearsing, which the old bare-quote key made look already-saved; and a second
click landing in the same tick as the first read `banked` before React had
updated it and wrote a duplicate. The button also says *saving* until the row
exists — it used to claim saved before the write and roll back on failure.

**`/MistakeBank` answers "am I actually fixing these?"** — not "what did I get
wrong", which is a guilt list and a screen nobody opens twice. The headline is
a fraction of what is FIXED, the bar shows the pile shrinking, and repeats are
called out because a student told they have dropped one criterion four times
has one thing to fix instead of four.

`fixState` reads the SM-2 counters already on the card — nothing new is stored
to support it. Fixed is two clean recalls AND an interval of a week or more:
one recall the day after banking is short-term memory, and telling a student
they have fixed something they have not is the flattery the rank system exists
to refuse. Slipping is their LAST answer, not their history, so a card with
four early lapses since recalled twice reads as going the right way.

READY IS NOT DUE. `due.js` counts a never-reviewed card as *new* on purpose —
a fresh sixty-card deck must not report sixty overdue. But a mistake banked an
hour ago is not unopened material; the student got it wrong this morning. The
page passes "due or new", so a bank with five mistakes never opens on "nothing
due today", which is the dead end the screen exists to avoid.

**The bank DRILLS, it does not show you the answer.** A two-sided card is
RECOGNITION, and recognition feels like learning because the answer looks
familiar when you see it — the exact illusion the landing page calls out by
name. So a mistake gets harder as the student gets it right (`drill.js`):

  RECOGNISE  first time. What they wrote, what would have scored. There is
             nothing to retrieve yet; asking somebody to produce a wording
             nobody has shown them is a test, not a drill.
  CLOZE      the model wording with the load-bearing terms removed, and those
             same terms as the word bank. No invented distractors — every word
             belongs in a gap, so there is nothing to eliminate by feel.
  PRODUCE    the criterion alone and a box, marked by the model against that
             one criterion. This is the rung that transfers, because a SAC is
             a box.

The rung is read off `repetitions`, so nothing new is stored and a lapse drops
the card back down the ladder WITH the scheduler rather than leaving it hard
while its interval collapses. `keyTerms` blanks what the CRITERION turns on —
words in both the criterion and the answer — never a stopword, never the
opening word (a passage that starts with a hole has no context before it), and
three gaps at most. **A rung that cannot be built falls back rather than
degrading**: no blankable terms, no cloze; no criterion, no produce.

The model SUGGESTS a rating and highlights that button; the student still
presses one. An app that schedules a card off its own verdict has taken the one
judgement only they can make — whether they knew it or guessed. A failed
marking call is not a dead end either: the model wording appears and they rate
themselves, which is the rung below.

The review runs ON the page. A review screen that sends you elsewhere to review
is not one. It grades through `sm2.js` — `calculateNextReview`, the rating
scale and `reviewPatch`, moved out of SpacedRepetition.jsx unchanged for
exactly this, the same move `mastery.js` already made. Two schedulers for one
card is how an app starts disagreeing with itself. `reviewPatch` names the
columns so the derived `_mastery_score` cannot reach a table with no column for
it — PostgREST rejects the whole row and the student loses the rating.

Provenance rides in `extra.mistake` (criterion, quote, question, cost), because
grouping by criterion cannot parse it back out of question prose that will be
reworded. Cards banked before it exists still count, still review and still
show their state; they just cannot be grouped. And `unit` is CONSTANT — the
shelf keys decks on subject|topic|unit, so putting "Lost mark" there split one
student's bank into two decks per subject.

**Handwriting goes to `VISION_MODEL`**, not the prose default — Saver included.
A downgraded model produces a wrong transcript and the transcript is what gets
MARKED, so the saving comes out of the student's marks. Mathpix's `v3/strokes`
endpoint takes the exact shape `ink.js` already produces and is purpose-built
for this; it is not wired up, and doing so needs an account and a key.

**Marking is itemised, and the itemisation is the truth.** `quizMarking.js`
returns criteria (what the assessor wanted, each got or missed, each worth n
marks) and edits (word-level swaps in the student's own words). If the model
states a total that contradicts its own criteria, THE CRITERIA WIN and the
number is recomputed — a total that visibly disagrees with the list under it
costs the marking all its credibility. The denominator always comes from the
question, never from the model, or a marker can silently rescale a score.
`MarkPanel` renders it with the landing page's own pen strokes (`PenMarks`,
extracted from `MarkedWord` and put on design tokens). It REPLACES the prose
panels rather than joining them — the same finding stated twice is worse.

**THE CRITERIA ARE THE LEDGER. Annotations are evidence for it, never a second
verdict.** They used to be two independent judgements and they contradicted
each other in front of the student: the criteria said which marks were dropped,
and the annotations, chosen separately by the model, put "Cost a mark −1" on a
phrase with nothing forcing agreement. A clean 3/3 could sit directly above a
sentence underlined in red and told it cost a mark. So `linkAnnotations` binds
every annotation to a criterion, and the link decides what it may claim —
missed criterion → it cost exactly that criterion's marks; earned criterion →
imprecise, cost nothing; linked to nothing → it may not bill a mark it is not
attached to. Marks lost is the sum of the missed criteria and nothing else,
which is `outOf - marks` by construction, and every "costing you" figure on the
screen comes off that one subtraction (`markLedger`).

`criterionIndexFor` REFUSES rather than guesses — index, then exact match on
normalised text, then containment of at least 8 characters. Unlinked is safe
and visible; mislinked blames the wrong mark, which is what the join exists to
prevent. Watch `Number(null) === 0`: coercing the index attached every unlinked
annotation to the first criterion on the page, silently and plausibly.

**The ink pad holds one line.** Write a step, it is recognised, it lifts off
the pad into the typeset stack above, the pad clears. That is the whole
anti-crowding design: nothing accumulates on the writing surface. Recognition
is Claude vision over the upload path that already exists — no new dependency,
nothing new on the server. A small in-browser digit model was the alternative
and it handles isolated digits and nothing else: no fractions, roots, integrals
or superscripts, which is to say it fails on exactly the maths this is for.

Every recognised line stays editable before submission. A student marked down
for the transcriber's mistake would be invisible to us and infuriating to them.
The transcript is what gets marked; the strokes are session-only, because the
saved answer is a plain string like every other answer.

## Cards are the app's visual language

`PlayingCard` + `cardIdentity` are used on eighteen surfaces — marketing, the
signup wizard, Dashboard, Subjects, Review, the flashcard shelf, and inside the
quiz player. **Rank is how strong the thing is, suit is the family it belongs
to**, and that contract holds everywhere: deck mastery, quiz best score, a
subject in the signup hand. An Ace is always earned, never given.

`CardPack` is the shared pack — backs behind, one face on top, thickness = the
count, fan on hover. `DeckStack` (flashcard decks) and `QuizDeck` (quizzes) are
thin faces on it; before the extraction they were two near-identical
two-hundred-line components, which is the copy that rots.

If you are about to render a list of anything deck-shaped, it goes on
`CardPack`. The quiz list was the last holdout — an icon in a rounded square, a
title, two pills and three grey stat tiles reading Attempts / Best / Avg —
and a grid of those is precisely what makes an app look generated. Tapping one
also dropped you straight into a card table, so the seam was in the middle of
the flow the page exists to start.

Three things that took a rebuild to learn:

- **One number on the face.** A card has room for one figure and it should be
  the one that answers "what now" — due, or the score to beat. The rest goes on
  the screen behind it.
- **Actions go in the gutter under the card, not its top-right corner.** That
  corner is where the title starts. They were `opacity-0` until hover, which
  hid the collision and also made delete unreachable on a touch screen.
- **One pack per row on a phone is correct.** Narrowing the card to fit two
  does not fit two and clips the face trying. Two-up arrives at `sm`.

## The dashboard answers one question

**"What do I do right now."** Today's Play is the page; everything else is
context around it. Progress belongs on Ranked and Analytics, which exist to
show it properly — the distance-to-target block was removed for that reason,
and it was the third progress readout on one screen.

The table stays. `TableGround`, `Placed` and the fanned `HandRail` are the only
place in the app with that vocabulary and they are what stop a page full of
cards reading as a document. Concordance means the panels obey the same tokens
and card shapes as the rest, not that the felt goes.

Nothing is printed twice. The streak had its number in the header strip AND a
panel below with the run of seven in it; the panel says it properly, so the
strip stopped saying it at all.

**The hero MAKES A CASE, it does not assert one.** Three columns: the card,
the move and one button, and the rail — what fired it, what skipping it costs,
and what it is worth in ATAR points (`todaysCase.js`).

EVERY RAIL ROW IS DROPPED WHEN ITS NUMBER IS NOT REAL, and the rail disappears
when none survive. A first-week account has no components and no cards below
recall; printing "+0.00 ATAR" at them teaches a student that the numbers on
this page are decoration, after which the real ones do not land either.

The payoff is ATAR points and never XP. `liftFor` differences two runs of the
same model Ranked uses, so it is checkable; XP is a number the app invented.

**The card turns over to the actual work.** This column has been a dealt
playing card, then a 3D brain, and is a card again — but not the same card.
The first turned over to an icon and the move's LABEL, which is the headline
beside it restated in the largest element on the page. The brain carried real
information and none of it was about the work; interesting once, then never
again on a screen opened every morning.

It now turns over to the real question off their own deck, the real assessment
title, or the clock counting the block. `previewFor` NEVER invents a face —
every branch returns null rather than a placeholder, because the card turns on
a promise ("here is the first one") and a face reading "your question will
appear here" breaks it on the one interaction the panel asks for. With nothing
real, it keeps the old icon-and-label face, which promises nothing.

The rank still carries urgency (Ace = deadline, Jack = not started). It could
never justify the space alone; the face is what pays for it.

Two things the brain took with it when it went. The rail's "4 regions your
recent work hasn't touched" row — evidence that only reads next to a graphic
goes when the graphic does, or it is jargon a student cannot check. And
`CommitmentRun`'s ghost pack, which existed to give the empty state an object:
with a real card two inches away, a second row of card shapes reads as a
loading skeleton. The sentence asking for a commitment stays either way.

A move needs `technique` (which regions) and `component` (which ATAR slice) to
have a case at all, and `why` for its trigger row. Add a move without them and
it silently renders bare.

**A flip is a tween; a deal is a spring.** MovePreview's card wobbled on its
way over because both animations shared one `animate` on one spring — hovering
re-entered it with velocity still on `rotate` and `scale`. They are nested now:
outer does the deal once, inner does `rotateY` alone on a fixed 0.42s tween, so
a fast hover-out-hover-in cannot stutter. `perspective` goes on the PARENT; an
element cannot supply its own vanishing point, and on the child a rotateY reads
as a horizontal squash.

**And hover detection NEVER goes on the element that rotates.** That was the
real cause and the tween alone did not fix it. As the card turns through 90°
its projected width collapses to nothing, so the stationary pointer falls
outside its own hit box — `pointerleave` fires, it turns back, the box widens,
`pointerenter` fires, forever. Holding the mouse still made it oscillate, which
is why it looked like an animation bug and was not. `onPointerEnter`/`Leave`
sit on the static wrapper now; only the inner element rotates. Anything that
scales, rotates or flips on hover has this bug waiting in it.

**Clearing the pile is an event, and the dashboard says so.** A student who
worked through their cards — or cleared them on /Review by marking them known —
came back to a hero that behaved as though nothing had happened. There is an
"all caught up" move now, and it is only claimed by somebody who HAS a deck to
be caught up on; congratulating an empty account on owning nothing is worse
than silence. A pile under ten also no longer falls through the cracks: the
high-priority branch needs ten to beat a streak on the line, the low-priority
one only has to beat a generic Pomodoro.

## The signup tour

`AceTour` — six stops and a sign-off, fired once for accounts that are hours
old. Ace walks in on Dashboard, Subjects, Study, Quizzes, Planner and Help,
says what each is for, and hands them back to the Dashboard. Copy and
eligibility live in `src/lib/aceTour.js`; the component navigates, speaks and
remembers the stop index so a refresh resumes rather than restarts.

It is a tour, not an onboarding run. Nothing is gated on the student having
done something, nothing pays XP, no step can be failed. The version that did
all of that was a client library, a component, a server payout source and six
anchor attributes scattered through the pages — reverted in `be14756`, and
worth reading that commit before proposing it again.

Two rules it exists to keep:

- **It can only ever fire for genuinely new accounts.** Eligibility is derived
  from `user_profiles.created_date`, not from a flag needing a backfill: older
  than `TOUR_WINDOW_HOURS` and nothing starts, nothing is written. An unknown
  age counts as old. Getting this wrong the generous way ambushes all ~130
  existing accounts at once; getting it wrong the other way costs one student a
  tour.
- **He is drawn with `AceWalker` + `AceBubble`**, the pair AceBuddy uses, so he
  arrives the way he arrives everywhere else. The first version pointed him at
  each page's `<h1>` through AceRoam and he clipped under the nav — headings
  are near the top, that is what headings are.

Layout stands AceIntro and AceBuddy down while it runs; they share the corner
and the mascot. It goes quiet on the payment flow, because the wizard sends
premium-intent signups straight to /Subscription.

## Study intent

The Dashboard modal asks what today is for (homework / cramming / free study)
and how long. The answer lives on `user_profiles.extra.daily_intent`, with a
capped `intent_log` for history. `src/lib/studyIntent.js` is the shared read and
owns the mode→technique→tool mapping.

It threads: Today's move leads with it, Study opens on the matching technique,
AI Tools on the matching persona, the greeting closes the loop once minutes are
logged, and kept intents feed the ATAR's planning component. The mapping matches
the advice the modal itself gives — change one, change both, or the app argues
with itself one screen later.

### Functions ported (in `server.mjs`)
- **XP/Streak (4)**: `updateStreak`, `awardXP`, `awardXPIncremental`, `awardGoalXP`. JWT auth helper + `supabaseAdmin` (service_role) live at `server.mjs:28-60`.
- **Goal AI (2)**: `updateGoalProgress`, `generateGoalWithAI`. Helpers `callLocalFn` / `callInvokeAI` near top of `server.mjs` let one ported function call another.
- **Competitions + Wagers (5)**: `createGoalCompetition`, `joinGoalCompetition`, `updateCompetitionProgress`, `settleHoursCompetition`, `resolveScoreWager`. Migration `0008_competitions_wagers_schema.sql` realigned `goal_competitions` (drop+recreate) and `score_wagers` (rename `wager_xp` → `wagered_xp`, add accuracy/xp_outcome/actual_score/assessment_id, status enum changed to active/resolved/cancelled).

### Functions deprecated (won't migrate)
- **Challenges (3)**: `saveChallengeProgress`, `completeGoalChallenge`, `generateGoalChallenge` — never wired into live UI. `ChallengeEngine.jsx` deleted. Migration 0007 columns are orphan but harmless.
- **Past papers (2)**: `fetchVCAAPaper`, `renderPdfPages` — VCAAExamSimulator/PastPapersSection/PastPaperPlayer/AITestMarkerSection were all dead code, deleted 2026-05-05.

### Functions ported (continued)
- **Support (1)**: `sendSupportTicket` — ticket saves to DB AND sends two Resend emails (admin notification to `ADMIN_EMAIL`, confirmation to user). Sender domain `acedit.au` is DNS-verified in Resend. Wired 2026-05-19.

### Functions remaining
- **Admin (3)**: `resetAllCredits`, `migrateStudyHoursToXP`, `banAbusiveAccounts` — admin-only, can defer post-cutover. Genuinely unported: no handler exists in `server.mjs` for any of them.

Stripe is **not** remaining. All four (`stripeCheckout`, `stripePortal`,
`verifySubscription`, `stripe-webhook`) are live in `server.mjs` and wired in
`supabaseClient.js` — this section listed them as outstanding for months while
the phase table above said they were ported, and every session that read it was
sent to write code that already existed.

Still worth confirming rather than assuming: the webhook path needs a public
URL, so it may never have run against a real Stripe event. If subscriptions are
not activating after payment, start there, not at the port.

Recommended next: nothing in the migration is blocking. Product work is the
better use of a session — see below.

## Run / develop

```bash
npm run dev    # vite :5173 + server.mjs :3001 concurrently
```

`.env.local` (gitignored) holds `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `VITE_BASE44_APP_ID`, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `VITE_USE_SUPABASE`.

## Reads are cached, and pages are split

Two things every session should know before adding a query or a page.

**Every entity read goes through one cache** (`src/api/readCache.js`, wired in
`supabaseClient.js`). Its real job is DEDUPE, not memory: six components mount
on first paint and five of them ask for the same `user_profiles` row, so they
share one promise. The 8s TTL only absorbs remount storms. react-query is
installed and configured and still nothing uses it — caching at the shim was
one file against migrating 159 call sites, and that trade has not changed.

Invalidation is eager and coarse on purpose: any write drops every cached read
of that table, any non-read server function drops everything (`awardXP` alone
touches xp_events, user_profiles and leaderboards), and any auth event drops
the lot plus the memoised email and `auth.me()`. If you add a ported function
that only reads, put it in `READ_ONLY_FUNCTIONS`; if you are not sure what it
writes, leave it out. Getting that wrong shows a student a stale XP total the
moment after they earned it.

**Reads page.** PostgREST caps a response at 1000 rows and says nothing about
it, so every unbounded `.filter({...})` was silently truncating for anyone past
that many flashcards or xp_events. `fetchPaged` walks 1000 at a time with `id`
as a tiebreak so a row cannot land on two pages, up to a 20000 ceiling that
WARNS when it bites rather than handing back a prefix — the same failure the
ATAR window queries hit.

**Pages are lazy** (`pages.config.js`, `Suspense` in `App.jsx`). Statically
imported, the 24 pages plus recharts, KaTeX and html2canvas built one 4MB
bundle that every student parsed before the dashboard painted; it is 1.4MB now
and the dashboard adds 61KB. Landing, Login and Layout stay in the first chunk
because they are what an unauthenticated visitor and every route respectively
need immediately. The Suspense boundary sits INSIDE the layout so a navigation
reads as the page filling in, not the app blinking out. `routes.test.mjs`
accepts either binding form — a route registered against an undeclared name is
the 404 it exists to catch, and that looks the same either way.

Write loops are gone from the paths that had them (Goals, Strategise,
StrategyCheckIn, MindMaps, BlurtingMethod, Review): same-payload rows go
through `bulkCreate`/`bulkUpdate`, and independent ones through `Promise.all`.
A rebuilt fortnight was thirty sequential round trips with the button spinning
through all of them.

## Known issues / paper-cuts

- Console 400s on `/study_plans` and `/flashcards` — missing-column patches. Non-blocking.
- Lint is at ~46 warnings, down from 190. What's left is mostly unread state; the
  genuinely dead things have been removed. Worth reading a warning before deleting
  it — twice now an "unused" symbol turned out to mark a half-wired feature, not
  dead code (the shared-quiz handlers, Layout's unreachable UpgradeModal).
- No test runner is configured — there is no vitest or jest. What exists is a
  set of plain-node assertion files (`src/lib/*.test.mjs`, run through
  `_aliasLoader.mjs`) wired into `npm test`. Adding a real runner is still a
  decision, not a freebie.
- **A feature gated behind an optional-looking step is a feature nobody has.**
  Blurting's AI marking rendered only when source notes had been uploaded — an
  upload sitting in a side panel on the setup screen, next to a "How Blurting
  Works" list that promised "AI checks what you missed" unconditionally. The
  marking worked; almost nobody ever saw it, which is the likeliest reason
  blurting reads as zero in the usage audit. It marks either way now, against
  the Study Design when there are no notes, and says which of the two it did.
  Worth checking the same shape elsewhere before blaming a technique for being
  unpopular.
- **An icon that restates the word next to it is decoration.** A clock in a
  tile beside the heading "Pomodoro", a sparkle before "Good for:", a brain
  before "Your brain on X" — and behind all of it a 128px ghosted clock at 10%
  opacity. Three clocks in one panel. That stacking is most of what reads as
  vibe-coded, and it is the same instinct as the emoji sweep: decoration added
  because the space looked empty.
  The rule is whether the glyph carries something the text does not. **Keep**
  logo lockups, status (check, warning, spinner), empty-state anchors, icons
  that differentiate items in a repeated set, and the wand/sparkle ON an AI
  generate button — there it is the affordance. **Cut** ghosted watermarks,
  icon tiles in front of a heading that names the same thing, and generic
  Sparkles/Star/Crown/Zap on a standalone label.
  Sets are kept whole: pulling one icon out of five sibling category headings
  looks like a bug rather than a decision.
- Copy drifts away from the product. Retired features kept being advertised
  (weekly leagues on the paid tier, a Study Roadmap page that redirects, past
  papers in Revision Mode) and the AI tool count was hand-written as three
  different numbers across five screens. Tool count now derives from
  `TOOL_COUNT` in `chatTools.js`. When you retire something, grep the copy.
- Long subagent runs in this codebase have repeatedly hit 600s stream-idle timeouts. Avoid long-running subagents — do work in the main conversation or split into smaller agent tasks.
- `package.json` `name` is still `base44-app` and `@base44/sdk` + `@base44/vite-plugin` are still listed (kept for dual-run; remove after cutover).

**A button names the JOB, not the technology.** "AI Generate" told a student
which technology was involved and nothing about what would happen — on the
Study page it could plausibly have made cards, marked something, or written an
answer. They say the work now: *Make cards from notes*, *Make a quiz from
notes*, *Make questions from my notes*, *Mark my answers*, *Mark what I
missed*. The wand stays; on a generate button the icon IS the affordance.

And a disabled button says WHY. Active Recall's needed both a subject and a
file and sat greyed out saying neither.

One dialog, one button per surface. Making a quiz had three buttons on the
Quizzes page; the one in the side panel only existed because that panel used to
be about quizzing, and three buttons for one dialog is how a student stops
believing they do different things.

## Voice / UX guardrails (from prior decisions)

- **Tone**: chill motivational coach. Never cocky.
- **Banned words**: "Don't", "Fix it", "No excuses", "Embarrassing", "Move".
- **Primary green** `#58CC02` (Duolingo-like). XP orange, streak red, chart-3 blue, chart-4 purple. Use design tokens, not raw hex.
- **Static Tailwind classes only** — JIT can't see template-string class names. Recurring gotcha.
- **Streaming AI for prose tools, NOT JSON tools.** In the unified chat this is
  the `artifact` spec on a tool in `chatTools.js`: declaring one switches that
  send to a single non-streaming schema call. Cheat sheet, exam questions and
  the line memoriser all take that path.
- **Collect nothing you don't use.** The recurring bug in this app is asking the
  student something and then ignoring the answer — the study intent was
  discarded on close, the duration they picked was never read, the ATAR
  components were computed and never shown. If you add an input, wire it through
  the same session.
- **The running timer is a clock, not a glyph beside a number.**
  `PomodoroOrb` — a green (amber on break) face that glows, with an arc for how
  much of the block is left and a hand that steps 6° every second. The arc is
  an explicit SVG arc path with sweep-flag 1, NOT a `strokeDashoffset` on a
  circle: the dash idiom is ambiguous about winding and the first version ran
  anticlockwise, which on a clock face is the one thing it must not do. It
  draws from `left` and `total` and nothing else, so the ring cannot disagree
  with the digits next to it, and with no `total` (older saved state) the ring
  is simply not drawn rather than drawn against a guess.
- **A suggestion that says "I'll build it" has to build it.** Ace's WhatToTest
  panel used to fill in two form fields and stop, leaving the student to scroll
  down and find the start button. `startFromSuggestion` takes the pick all the
  way into the session. It carries the choice in a ref, not state: the pick
  arrives in the same tick that sets the subject, so reading state would build
  the session for whatever subject was selected BEFORE they picked.
- **No mascot yet** (maybe later). **Dark mode EXISTS** — `index.css` has a
  complete `.dark` token block and `src/lib/theme.js` offers four preferences
  (system / light / dark / auto by the clock). This line used to say there was
  no dark mode, which sent every session that read it to write light-only CSS.
  Check both themes on any UI change.
- VCAA examiner prompts live in `src/lib/subjectExaminerPrompts.js` (34 subjects).

## Working style

- Be concise. Surface scope before big work.
- Test in browser before declaring done. UI changes need a real visual check.
- Don't introduce casual deps.
- The user has Anthropic API credit; don't worry about cost on small calls but don't run unbounded loops.

## Key files

- `server.mjs` — Anthropic proxy + ported functions
