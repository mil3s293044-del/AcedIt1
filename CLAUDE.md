# AcedIt — Claude Code briefing

This file is auto-loaded by any Claude Code session opened in this directory. It is the canonical handoff for the in-progress migration of the AcedIt app off Base44.

## What is AcedIt

AcedIt (acedit.au) is a gamified VCE study app for Australian high schoolers. It bundles AI study tools (essay planner, math tutor, note summariser, concept explainer, English mentor, exam simulator, etc.), quizzes, flashcards, leaderboards, goals, streaks, and XP. ~30 active / ~130 signed-up users on the live site.

## Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite 6, Tailwind 3.4, shadcn/Radix, framer-motion, react-router 6. JavaScript only (no TS).
- **Local server**: `server.mjs` (Express 5) on port 3001 — proxies Anthropic Claude and hosts ported Base44 functions.
- **Vite dev server**: port 5173. `npm run dev` runs both via `concurrently`.
- **Backend (target)**: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage). Project: `qhwyjycihgtxpzkitmpt.supabase.co`.
- **Auth**: Google OAuth (set up in Supabase, app code still uses Base44 — not yet swapped).
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude (default `claude-sonnet-4-6`, set in `server.mjs:17`). Replaces Base44's metered LLM.

## Migration plan (the "1% diff dual-run" strategy — already chosen)

The app reads/writes through shims that route to either Base44 or Supabase based on a runtime flag, so we cut over per-entity rather than big-bang.

- `src/api/runtimeConfig.js` — toggle (`VITE_USE_SUPABASE` env or `window.__forceSupabase(true)` in console).
- `src/api/entitiesShim.js`, `src/api/functionsShim.js` — route reads/writes/calls.
- `src/api/supabaseClient.js` — Supabase client + `PORTED_FUNCTIONS` list.
- `src/api/_dualRunDevTools.js` — diff helpers.

## Phase status

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Local replication of Base44 export | done |
| 2 | UI uplift (Duolingo/Cal-AI vibe, design tokens, page-by-page restyle, LaTeX, streaming) | done |
| 3a | Supabase schema + migrations 0001–0006 | done (applied) |
| 3b | Port Base44 serverless functions into `server.mjs` | **18 of 18 done** (3 challenge + 2 past papers deprecated; admin 3 deferred post-cutover; Stripe 4 ported 2026-05-05 — needs ngrok for webhook testing in dev) |
| 3c | Data migration script + cutover for ~130 users | **done** (132 user_profiles + 42 leaderboards migrated 2026-05-08; smaller entities skipped — users re-select subjects post-cutover) |
| 3d | Swap `AuthContext.jsx` from Base44 to Supabase Google OAuth | **done** (2026-05-08; dual-run via `shouldUseSupabase()` toggle, Base44 path preserved for rollback) |
| 4 | Capacitor wrap → iOS app via Xcode | future |

## The AcedIt ATAR

The flagship score everything else is standardised around. 0–99.95, trailing 28
days, **not** a VCAA prediction and the UI says so wherever it appears. Computed
in `computeAcedItATAR` (`server.mjs`), stored on `user_profiles.acedit_atar` +
`atar_components`, mirrored to `leaderboards`.

Mastery 28% · consistency 27% · effort 22% · breadth 13% · planning 10%.
Unranked under 3 study days. Planning is goals set-and-met, planned blocks kept,
prep started before an assessment, and declared study intents actually followed
— its weights live in `computePlanning`.

Every component reports the evidence behind it in `atar_components`, and Ranked
renders it under each bar. If you add a component, add its counts too — a bare
percentage tells a student nothing they can act on. `planningEvidence` in
`src/lib/atarBands.js` is the one wording, shared by Ranked and AtarPanel.

Two traps this component has fallen into already, both fixed 2026-08-28:

- **Read every table the behaviour lands in.** Pomodoro, active recall,
  blurting and spaced repetition write to `study_techniques`; only quizzes and
  the activity tracker write to `study_sessions`. Planning read just the latter,
  so kept blocks, prep and kept intents all scored near zero for students who
  used the Study page — the exact "planning is 22" the Ranked comment cites.
- **Never score a student on a signal they can't reach.** Prep is only
  applicable once an assessment is on the calendar and its lead-up has begun;
  its weight is redistributed when there isn't one, rather than banked as a
  zero. Same rule for grading an assessment that's still two weeks out.

- **`xp_awarded > 0` is not "did they study".** All five components read one
  predicate now: an event counts if it paid XP *or* was capped. The caps govern
  the XP economy, not the study log — `awardXPIncremental` says as much where it
  writes the row ("capping the payout must not stop the counting") — so gating
  on payout quietly deleted a student's *best* days from consistency, effort,
  mastery and breadth. A zero-content session (raw XP zero, uncapped) still
  doesn't count; there's no work in it to measure. Velocity-capped rows count
  too: 600 XP/hour is reachable honestly with a 2× streak on a long session.

Effort totals minutes per day and clamps each day at `EFFORT_DAILY_MINUTE_CAP`,
because `duration_minutes` comes from the client. The daily XP cap used to bound
this incidentally, and badly — where it landed moved with the student's streak
multiplier. And every window query pages (`fetchAllRows`): an unordered
`.limit(n)` on `xp_events` handed heavy users an arbitrary prefix of their own
log, which cost them breadth, effort and mastery at once.

Client mirror of the band thresholds is `src/lib/atarBands.js`. Server is the
source of truth; keep them in sync.

## Study intent

The Dashboard modal asks what today is for (homework / cramming / free study)
and how long. The answer lives on `user_profiles.extra.daily_intent`, with a
capped `intent_log` for history. `src/lib/studyIntent.js` is the shared read and
owns the mode→technique→tool mapping.

It threads: Today's move leads with it, Study opens on the matching technique,
AI Tools on the matching persona, the greeting closes the loop once minutes are
logged, and kept intents feed the ATAR's planning component. The mapping matches
the advice the modal itself gives — change one, change both, or the app argues
with itself one screen later.

### Functions ported (in `server.mjs`)
- **XP/Streak (4)**: `updateStreak`, `awardXP`, `awardXPIncremental`, `awardGoalXP`. JWT auth helper + `supabaseAdmin` (service_role) live at `server.mjs:28-60`.
- **Goal AI (2)**: `updateGoalProgress`, `generateGoalWithAI`. Helpers `callLocalFn` / `callInvokeAI` near top of `server.mjs` let one ported function call another.
- **Competitions + Wagers (5)**: `createGoalCompetition`, `joinGoalCompetition`, `updateCompetitionProgress`, `settleHoursCompetition`, `resolveScoreWager`. Migration `0008_competitions_wagers_schema.sql` realigned `goal_competitions` (drop+recreate) and `score_wagers` (rename `wager_xp` → `wagered_xp`, add accuracy/xp_outcome/actual_score/assessment_id, status enum changed to active/resolved/cancelled).

### Functions deprecated (won't migrate)
- **Challenges (3)**: `saveChallengeProgress`, `completeGoalChallenge`, `generateGoalChallenge` — never wired into live UI. `ChallengeEngine.jsx` deleted. Migration 0007 columns are orphan but harmless.
- **Past papers (2)**: `fetchVCAAPaper`, `renderPdfPages` — VCAAExamSimulator/PastPapersSection/PastPaperPlayer/AITestMarkerSection were all dead code, deleted 2026-05-05.

### Functions ported (continued)
- **Support (1)**: `sendSupportTicket` — ticket saves to DB AND sends two Resend emails (admin notification to `ADMIN_EMAIL`, confirmation to user). Sender domain `acedit.au` is DNS-verified in Resend. Wired 2026-05-19.

### Functions remaining
- **Admin (3)**: `resetAllCredits`, `migrateStudyHoursToXP`, `banAbusiveAccounts` — admin-only, can defer post-cutover. Genuinely unported: no handler exists in `server.mjs` for any of them.

Stripe is **not** remaining. All four (`stripeCheckout`, `stripePortal`,
`verifySubscription`, `stripe-webhook`) are live in `server.mjs` and wired in
`supabaseClient.js` — this section listed them as outstanding for months while
the phase table above said they were ported, and every session that read it was
sent to write code that already existed.

Still worth confirming rather than assuming: the webhook path needs a public
URL, so it may never have run against a real Stripe event. If subscriptions are
not activating after payment, start there, not at the port.

Recommended next: nothing in the migration is blocking. Product work is the
better use of a session — see below.

## Run / develop

```bash
npm run dev    # vite :5173 + server.mjs :3001 concurrently
```

`.env.local` (gitignored) holds `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `VITE_BASE44_APP_ID`, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `VITE_USE_SUPABASE`.

## Known issues / paper-cuts

- Console 400s on `/study_plans` and `/flashcards` — missing-column patches. Non-blocking.
- Lint is at ~46 warnings, down from 190. What's left is mostly unread state; the
  genuinely dead things have been removed. Worth reading a warning before deleting
  it — twice now an "unused" symbol turned out to mark a half-wired feature, not
  dead code (the shared-quiz handlers, Layout's unreachable UpgradeModal).
- No test runner is configured. There is no `test` script, no vitest, no jest.
  Adding one is a real decision, not a freebie.
- Copy drifts away from the product. Retired features kept being advertised
  (weekly leagues on the paid tier, a Study Roadmap page that redirects, past
  papers in Revision Mode) and the AI tool count was hand-written as three
  different numbers across five screens. Tool count now derives from
  `TOOL_COUNT` in `chatTools.js`. When you retire something, grep the copy.
- Long subagent runs in this codebase have repeatedly hit 600s stream-idle timeouts. Avoid long-running subagents — do work in the main conversation or split into smaller agent tasks.
- `package.json` `name` is still `base44-app` and `@base44/sdk` + `@base44/vite-plugin` are still listed (kept for dual-run; remove after cutover).

## Voice / UX guardrails (from prior decisions)

- **Tone**: chill motivational coach. Never cocky.
- **Banned words**: "Don't", "Fix it", "No excuses", "Embarrassing", "Move".
- **Primary green** `#58CC02` (Duolingo-like). XP orange, streak red, chart-3 blue, chart-4 purple. Use design tokens, not raw hex.
- **Static Tailwind classes only** — JIT can't see template-string class names. Recurring gotcha.
- **Streaming AI for prose tools, NOT JSON tools.** In the unified chat this is
  the `artifact` spec on a tool in `chatTools.js`: declaring one switches that
  send to a single non-streaming schema call. Cheat sheet, exam questions and
  the line memoriser all take that path.
- **Collect nothing you don't use.** The recurring bug in this app is asking the
  student something and then ignoring the answer — the study intent was
  discarded on close, the duration they picked was never read, the ATAR
  components were computed and never shown. If you add an input, wire it through
  the same session.
- **No mascot yet** (maybe later). **No dark mode yet** (later).
- VCAA examiner prompts live in `src/lib/subjectExaminerPrompts.js` (34 subjects).

## Working style

- Be concise. Surface scope before big work.
- Test in browser before declaring done. UI changes need a real visual check.
- Don't introduce casual deps.
- The user has Anthropic API credit; don't worry about cost on small calls but don't run unbounded loops.
