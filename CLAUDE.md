# AcedIt — Claude Code briefing

This file is auto-loaded by any Claude Code session opened in this directory. It is the canonical handoff for the in-progress migration of the AcedIt app off Base44.

## What is AcedIt

AcedIt (acedit.au) is a gamified VCE study app for Australian high schoolers. It bundles AI study tools (essay planner, math tutor, note summariser, concept explainer, English mentor, exam simulator, etc.), quizzes, flashcards, leaderboards, goals, streaks, and XP. ~30 active / ~130 signed-up users on the live site.

## Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite 6, Tailwind 3.4, shadcn/Radix, framer-motion, react-router 6. JavaScript only (no TS).
- **Local server**: `server.mjs` (Express 5) on port 3001 — proxies Anthropic Claude and hosts ported Base44 functions.
- **Vite dev server**: port 5173. `npm run dev` runs both via `concurrently`.
- **Backend (target)**: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage). Project: `qhwyjycihgtxpzkitmpt.supabase.co`.
- **Auth**: Google OAuth (set up in Supabase, app code still uses Base44 — not yet swapped).
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude (default `claude-sonnet-4-6`, set in `server.mjs:17`). Replaces Base44's metered LLM.

## Migration plan (the "1% diff dual-run" strategy — already chosen)

The app reads/writes through shims that route to either Base44 or Supabase based on a runtime flag, so we cut over per-entity rather than big-bang.

- `src/api/runtimeConfig.js` — toggle (`VITE_USE_SUPABASE` env or `window.__forceSupabase(true)` in console).
- `src/api/entitiesShim.js`, `src/api/functionsShim.js` — route reads/writes/calls.
- `src/api/supabaseClient.js` — Supabase client + `PORTED_FUNCTIONS` list.
- `src/api/_dualRunDevTools.js` — diff helpers.

## Phase status

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Local replication of Base44 export | done |
| 2 | UI uplift (Duolingo/Cal-AI vibe, design tokens, page-by-page restyle, LaTeX, streaming) | done |
| 3a | Supabase schema + migrations 0001–0006 | done (applied) |
| 3b | Port Base44 serverless functions into `server.mjs` | **18 of 18 done** (3 challenge + 2 past papers deprecated; admin 3 deferred post-cutover; Stripe 4 ported 2026-05-05 — needs ngrok for webhook testing in dev) |
| 3c | Data migration script + cutover for ~130 users | **done** (132 user_profiles + 42 leaderboards migrated 2026-05-08; smaller entities skipped — users re-select subjects post-cutover) |
| 3d | Swap `AuthContext.jsx` from Base44 to Supabase Google OAuth | **done** (2026-05-08; dual-run via `shouldUseSupabase()` toggle, Base44 path preserved for rollback) |
| 4 | Capacitor wrap → iOS app via Xcode | future |

## The AcedIt ATAR

The flagship score everything else is standardised around. 0–99.95, trailing 28
days, **not** a VCAA prediction and the UI says so wherever it appears. Computed
in `computeAcedItATAR` (`server.mjs`), stored on `user_profiles.acedit_atar` +
`atar_components`, mirrored to `leaderboards`.

Mastery 28% · consistency 27% · effort 22% · breadth 13% · planning 10%.
Unranked under 3 study days. Planning is goals set-and-met, planned blocks kept,
prep started before an assessment, and declared study intents actually followed
— its weights live in `computePlanning`.

Every component reports the evidence behind it in `atar_components`, and Ranked
renders it under each bar. If you add a component, add its counts too — a bare
percentage tells a student nothing they can act on. `planningEvidence` in
`src/lib/atarBands.js` is the one wording, shared by Ranked and AtarPanel.

Two traps this component has fallen into already, both fixed 2026-08-28:

- **Read every table the behaviour lands in.** Pomodoro, active recall,
  blurting and spaced repetition write to `study_techniques`; only quizzes and
  the activity tracker write to `study_sessions`. Planning read just the latter,
  so kept blocks, prep and kept intents all scored near zero for students who
  used the Study page — the exact "planning is 22" the Ranked comment cites.
- **Never score a student on a signal they can't reach.** Prep is only
  applicable once an assessment is on the calendar and its lead-up has begun;
  its weight is redistributed when there isn't one, rather than banked as a
  zero. Same rule for grading an assessment that's still two weeks out.

- **`xp_awarded > 0` is not "did they study".** All five components read one
  predicate now: an event counts if it paid XP *or* was capped. The caps govern
  the XP economy, not the study log — `awardXPIncremental` says as much where it
  writes the row ("capping the payout must not stop the counting") — so gating
  on payout quietly deleted a student's *best* days from consistency, effort,
  mastery and breadth. A zero-content session (raw XP zero, uncapped) still
  doesn't count; there's no work in it to measure. Velocity-capped rows count
  too: 600 XP/hour is reachable honestly with a 2× streak on a long session.

Effort totals minutes per day and clamps each day at `EFFORT_DAILY_MINUTE_CAP`,
because `duration_minutes` comes from the client. The daily XP cap used to bound
this incidentally, and badly — where it landed moved with the student's streak
multiplier. And every window query pages (`fetchAllRows`): an unordered
`.limit(n)` on `xp_events` handed heavy users an arbitrary prefix of their own
log, which cost them breadth, effort and mastery at once.

Client mirror of the band thresholds is `src/lib/atarBands.js`. Server is the
source of truth; keep them in sync.

## Quizzes: parts, ink, and itemised marking

**`quizSchema.js` is an adapter, not a format.** VCAA questions come in parts —
a stem, then (a), (b), (c) worth different marks. 76 places across thirteen
files read `.questions` and QuizPlayer alone branches on `type === 'mcq'` 41
times, so nothing branches on "is this the new shape": `normaliseQuestion`
turns BOTH into a stem plus one or more parts, and a legacy question becomes a
stem with a single unlabelled part.

**Answer keys are load-bearing.** Every attempt ever saved keys answers by
question index (`user_answers[3]`). A single-part question therefore keeps the
bare index — "3", not "3a" — or every existing attempt reads back as
unanswered. Only genuinely multi-part questions suffix.

Marks are the currency: score is a percentage of marks available, not of
questions answered, so a four-mark part b counts double a two-mark part a.
Three places used to compute a question's allocation by hand as
`q.type === 'mcq' ? 1 : (q.marks || 5)` and all three read 5 for a multipart
question worth nine — they go through `normaliseQuestion(q, i).marks` now,
which returns exactly the old value for a legacy question.

**The player branches ONCE.** `MultipartQuestion` owns the whole part-shaped
screen — stem in a quieter box, parts stacked below with the allocation
right-aligned the way a paper prints it, textarea rows scaling with the marks.
Everything else stays on the path it always took, which is why this cannot
reach the quizzes that already exist. Marking stays ONE entry per question with
the parts laid out inside the prompt, because the score, the feedback array and
the attempt row are all indexed by question.

Only the main generator (`handleGenerateQuiz`) emits parts. Reshuffle still
produces flat questions.

**Annotations point at characters, and an unquotable one is dropped.** The
marker returns a verbatim `quote` from the student's answer; `annotate.js`
finds it by EXACT string match and underlines only those characters, in place,
in their own paragraph. No fuzzy matching — underlining the wrong six words and
saying they cost a mark sends a student to rewrite a sentence that was fine and
costs the next annotation its credibility. Overlaps are dropped for the same
reason. Hover, tap and keyboard focus all open the note, because hover-only is
unusable on a phone.

The note is PORTALLED to the body and positioned `fixed` from a measured rect,
then clamped: below the phrase, else above it, else pinned inside the viewport
with its own scroll. All three cases are needed — a phrase near the right edge
or low on a short viewport used to open a note that ran off the screen, which
is the one place the marking says what to do. `position: fixed` resolves
against a transformed ancestor, and framer-motion leaves an inline transform on
every animated section here, so portalling is what makes `fixed` mean fixed.
AceRoam's header records the same lesson.

Each note carries what the assessor WANTED alongside what went wrong — the
issue is the half a student can see for themselves, `wanted` is the half they
cannot — and one or two suggested rewrites, never padded to two.

The marker writes like a VCAA examiner's report: it addresses the RESPONSE and
not the student, names the command term when the answer misread it, gives no
praise, and says what a full-mark response would have contained.

An annotation was a strikethrough over the whole phrase, off in its own card.
Both were wrong: a strikethrough means DELETE THIS when the point is LOOK HERE,
and lifting the phrase out of the paragraph loses the thing that makes it land.

**The mistake bank is flashcards with a marker** (`topic: "Mistake bank"`), so a
banked mistake comes back through the SM-2 engine that already exists rather
than sitting in a list nobody opens — same move blurting's `makeCardsFromMisses`
already makes. The card asks for the FIX, never for the mistake; a card that
rehearses the error is the opposite of the point.

**Handwriting goes to `VISION_MODEL`**, not the prose default — Saver included.
A downgraded model produces a wrong transcript and the transcript is what gets
MARKED, so the saving comes out of the student's marks. Mathpix's `v3/strokes`
endpoint takes the exact shape `ink.js` already produces and is purpose-built
for this; it is not wired up, and doing so needs an account and a key.

**Marking is itemised, and the itemisation is the truth.** `quizMarking.js`
returns criteria (what the assessor wanted, each got or missed, each worth n
marks) and edits (word-level swaps in the student's own words). If the model
states a total that contradicts its own criteria, THE CRITERIA WIN and the
number is recomputed — a total that visibly disagrees with the list under it
costs the marking all its credibility. The denominator always comes from the
question, never from the model, or a marker can silently rescale a score.
`MarkPanel` renders it with the landing page's own pen strokes (`PenMarks`,
extracted from `MarkedWord` and put on design tokens). It REPLACES the prose
panels rather than joining them — the same finding stated twice is worse.

**The ink pad holds one line.** Write a step, it is recognised, it lifts off
the pad into the typeset stack above, the pad clears. That is the whole
anti-crowding design: nothing accumulates on the writing surface. Recognition
is Claude vision over the upload path that already exists — no new dependency,
nothing new on the server. A small in-browser digit model was the alternative
and it handles isolated digits and nothing else: no fractions, roots, integrals
or superscripts, which is to say it fails on exactly the maths this is for.

Every recognised line stays editable before submission. A student marked down
for the transcriber's mistake would be invisible to us and infuriating to them.
The transcript is what gets marked; the strokes are session-only, because the
saved answer is a plain string like every other answer.

## Cards are the app's visual language

`PlayingCard` + `cardIdentity` are used on eighteen surfaces — marketing, the
signup wizard, Dashboard, Subjects, Review, the flashcard shelf, and inside the
quiz player. **Rank is how strong the thing is, suit is the family it belongs
to**, and that contract holds everywhere: deck mastery, quiz best score, a
subject in the signup hand. An Ace is always earned, never given.

`CardPack` is the shared pack — backs behind, one face on top, thickness = the
count, fan on hover. `DeckStack` (flashcard decks) and `QuizDeck` (quizzes) are
thin faces on it; before the extraction they were two near-identical
two-hundred-line components, which is the copy that rots.

If you are about to render a list of anything deck-shaped, it goes on
`CardPack`. The quiz list was the last holdout — an icon in a rounded square, a
title, two pills and three grey stat tiles reading Attempts / Best / Avg —
and a grid of those is precisely what makes an app look generated. Tapping one
also dropped you straight into a card table, so the seam was in the middle of
the flow the page exists to start.

Three things that took a rebuild to learn:

- **One number on the face.** A card has room for one figure and it should be
  the one that answers "what now" — due, or the score to beat. The rest goes on
  the screen behind it.
- **Actions go in the gutter under the card, not its top-right corner.** That
  corner is where the title starts. They were `opacity-0` until hover, which
  hid the collision and also made delete unreachable on a touch screen.
- **One pack per row on a phone is correct.** Narrowing the card to fit two
  does not fit two and clips the face trying. Two-up arrives at `sm`.

## The dashboard answers one question

**"What do I do right now."** Today's Play is the page; everything else is
context around it. Progress belongs on Ranked and Analytics, which exist to
show it properly — the distance-to-target block was removed for that reason,
and it was the third progress readout on one screen.

The table stays. `TableGround`, `Placed` and the fanned `HandRail` are the only
place in the app with that vocabulary and they are what stop a page full of
cards reading as a document. Concordance means the panels obey the same tokens
and card shapes as the rest, not that the felt goes.

Nothing is printed twice. The streak had its number in the header strip AND a
panel below with the run of seven in it; the panel says it properly, so the
strip stopped saying it at all.

## The signup tour

`AceTour` — six stops and a sign-off, fired once for accounts that are hours
old. Ace walks in on Dashboard, Subjects, Study, Quizzes, Planner and Help,
says what each is for, and hands them back to the Dashboard. Copy and
eligibility live in `src/lib/aceTour.js`; the component navigates, speaks and
remembers the stop index so a refresh resumes rather than restarts.

It is a tour, not an onboarding run. Nothing is gated on the student having
done something, nothing pays XP, no step can be failed. The version that did
all of that was a client library, a component, a server payout source and six
anchor attributes scattered through the pages — reverted in `be14756`, and
worth reading that commit before proposing it again.

Two rules it exists to keep:

- **It can only ever fire for genuinely new accounts.** Eligibility is derived
  from `user_profiles.created_date`, not from a flag needing a backfill: older
  than `TOUR_WINDOW_HOURS` and nothing starts, nothing is written. An unknown
  age counts as old. Getting this wrong the generous way ambushes all ~130
  existing accounts at once; getting it wrong the other way costs one student a
  tour.
- **He is drawn with `AceWalker` + `AceBubble`**, the pair AceBuddy uses, so he
  arrives the way he arrives everywhere else. The first version pointed him at
  each page's `<h1>` through AceRoam and he clipped under the nav — headings
  are near the top, that is what headings are.

Layout stands AceIntro and AceBuddy down while it runs; they share the corner
and the mascot. It goes quiet on the payment flow, because the wizard sends
premium-intent signups straight to /Subscription.

## Study intent

The Dashboard modal asks what today is for (homework / cramming / free study)
and how long. The answer lives on `user_profiles.extra.daily_intent`, with a
capped `intent_log` for history. `src/lib/studyIntent.js` is the shared read and
owns the mode→technique→tool mapping.

It threads: Today's move leads with it, Study opens on the matching technique,
AI Tools on the matching persona, the greeting closes the loop once minutes are
logged, and kept intents feed the ATAR's planning component. The mapping matches
the advice the modal itself gives — change one, change both, or the app argues
with itself one screen later.

### Functions ported (in `server.mjs`)
- **XP/Streak (4)**: `updateStreak`, `awardXP`, `awardXPIncremental`, `awardGoalXP`. JWT auth helper + `supabaseAdmin` (service_role) live at `server.mjs:28-60`.
- **Goal AI (2)**: `updateGoalProgress`, `generateGoalWithAI`. Helpers `callLocalFn` / `callInvokeAI` near top of `server.mjs` let one ported function call another.
- **Competitions + Wagers (5)**: `createGoalCompetition`, `joinGoalCompetition`, `updateCompetitionProgress`, `settleHoursCompetition`, `resolveScoreWager`. Migration `0008_competitions_wagers_schema.sql` realigned `goal_competitions` (drop+recreate) and `score_wagers` (rename `wager_xp` → `wagered_xp`, add accuracy/xp_outcome/actual_score/assessment_id, status enum changed to active/resolved/cancelled).

### Functions deprecated (won't migrate)
- **Challenges (3)**: `saveChallengeProgress`, `completeGoalChallenge`, `generateGoalChallenge` — never wired into live UI. `ChallengeEngine.jsx` deleted. Migration 0007 columns are orphan but harmless.
- **Past papers (2)**: `fetchVCAAPaper`, `renderPdfPages` — VCAAExamSimulator/PastPapersSection/PastPaperPlayer/AITestMarkerSection were all dead code, deleted 2026-05-05.

### Functions ported (continued)
- **Support (1)**: `sendSupportTicket` — ticket saves to DB AND sends two Resend emails (admin notification to `ADMIN_EMAIL`, confirmation to user). Sender domain `acedit.au` is DNS-verified in Resend. Wired 2026-05-19.

### Functions remaining
- **Admin (3)**: `resetAllCredits`, `migrateStudyHoursToXP`, `banAbusiveAccounts` — admin-only, can defer post-cutover. Genuinely unported: no handler exists in `server.mjs` for any of them.

Stripe is **not** remaining. All four (`stripeCheckout`, `stripePortal`,
`verifySubscription`, `stripe-webhook`) are live in `server.mjs` and wired in
`supabaseClient.js` — this section listed them as outstanding for months while
the phase table above said they were ported, and every session that read it was
sent to write code that already existed.

Still worth confirming rather than assuming: the webhook path needs a public
URL, so it may never have run against a real Stripe event. If subscriptions are
not activating after payment, start there, not at the port.

Recommended next: nothing in the migration is blocking. Product work is the
better use of a session — see below.

## Run / develop

```bash
npm run dev    # vite :5173 + server.mjs :3001 concurrently
```

`.env.local` (gitignored) holds `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `VITE_BASE44_APP_ID`, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `VITE_USE_SUPABASE`.

## Known issues / paper-cuts

- Console 400s on `/study_plans` and `/flashcards` — missing-column patches. Non-blocking.
- Lint is at ~46 warnings, down from 190. What's left is mostly unread state; the
  genuinely dead things have been removed. Worth reading a warning before deleting
  it — twice now an "unused" symbol turned out to mark a half-wired feature, not
  dead code (the shared-quiz handlers, Layout's unreachable UpgradeModal).
- No test runner is configured — there is no vitest or jest. What exists is a
  set of plain-node assertion files (`src/lib/*.test.mjs`, run through
  `_aliasLoader.mjs`) wired into `npm test`. Adding a real runner is still a
  decision, not a freebie.
- **A feature gated behind an optional-looking step is a feature nobody has.**
  Blurting's AI marking rendered only when source notes had been uploaded — an
  upload sitting in a side panel on the setup screen, next to a "How Blurting
  Works" list that promised "AI checks what you missed" unconditionally. The
  marking worked; almost nobody ever saw it, which is the likeliest reason
  blurting reads as zero in the usage audit. It marks either way now, against
  the Study Design when there are no notes, and says which of the two it did.
  Worth checking the same shape elsewhere before blaming a technique for being
  unpopular.
- **An icon that restates the word next to it is decoration.** A clock in a
  tile beside the heading "Pomodoro", a sparkle before "Good for:", a brain
  before "Your brain on X" — and behind all of it a 128px ghosted clock at 10%
  opacity. Three clocks in one panel. That stacking is most of what reads as
  vibe-coded, and it is the same instinct as the emoji sweep: decoration added
  because the space looked empty.
  The rule is whether the glyph carries something the text does not. **Keep**
  logo lockups, status (check, warning, spinner), empty-state anchors, icons
  that differentiate items in a repeated set, and the wand/sparkle ON an AI
  generate button — there it is the affordance. **Cut** ghosted watermarks,
  icon tiles in front of a heading that names the same thing, and generic
  Sparkles/Star/Crown/Zap on a standalone label.
  Sets are kept whole: pulling one icon out of five sibling category headings
  looks like a bug rather than a decision.
- Copy drifts away from the product. Retired features kept being advertised
  (weekly leagues on the paid tier, a Study Roadmap page that redirects, past
  papers in Revision Mode) and the AI tool count was hand-written as three
  different numbers across five screens. Tool count now derives from
  `TOOL_COUNT` in `chatTools.js`. When you retire something, grep the copy.
- Long subagent runs in this codebase have repeatedly hit 600s stream-idle timeouts. Avoid long-running subagents — do work in the main conversation or split into smaller agent tasks.
- `package.json` `name` is still `base44-app` and `@base44/sdk` + `@base44/vite-plugin` are still listed (kept for dual-run; remove after cutover).

## Voice / UX guardrails (from prior decisions)

- **Tone**: chill motivational coach. Never cocky.
- **Banned words**: "Don't", "Fix it", "No excuses", "Embarrassing", "Move".
- **Primary green** `#58CC02` (Duolingo-like). XP orange, streak red, chart-3 blue, chart-4 purple. Use design tokens, not raw hex.
- **Static Tailwind classes only** — JIT can't see template-string class names. Recurring gotcha.
- **Streaming AI for prose tools, NOT JSON tools.** In the unified chat this is
  the `artifact` spec on a tool in `chatTools.js`: declaring one switches that
  send to a single non-streaming schema call. Cheat sheet, exam questions and
  the line memoriser all take that path.
- **Collect nothing you don't use.** The recurring bug in this app is asking the
  student something and then ignoring the answer — the study intent was
  discarded on close, the duration they picked was never read, the ATAR
  components were computed and never shown. If you add an input, wire it through
  the same session.
- **No mascot yet** (maybe later). **Dark mode EXISTS** — `index.css` has a
  complete `.dark` token block and `src/lib/theme.js` offers four preferences
  (system / light / dark / auto by the clock). This line used to say there was
  no dark mode, which sent every session that read it to write light-only CSS.
  Check both themes on any UI change.
- VCAA examiner prompts live in `src/lib/subjectExaminerPrompts.js` (34 subjects).

## Working style

- Be concise. Surface scope before big work.
- Test in browser before declaring done. UI changes need a real visual check.
- Don't introduce casual deps.
- The user has Anthropic API credit; don't worry about cost on small calls but don't run unbounded loops.

## Key files

- `server.mjs` — Anthropic proxy + ported functions
- `src/api/supabaseClient.js`, `runtimeConfig.js`, `entitiesShim.js`, `functionsShim.js`, `_dualRunDevTools.js`
- `src/lib/AuthContext.jsx` — still on Base44, swap pending
- `src/lib/streamingAI.js`, `src/lib/reconcileXP.js`, `src/lib/subjectExaminerPrompts.js`
- `src/data/vceSubjects.js` — VCE subject catalog
- `src/components/shared/MarkdownMath.jsx`, `LatexRenderer.jsx` — KaTeX
- `supabase/migrations/0001…0006_*.sql` — applied schema
- `base44/entities/*.jsonc`, `base44/functions/*/` — Base44 reference, kept until cutover
